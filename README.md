This module should be a little helper if you found an exercise sheet instructing
the reader to solve a short paragraph of vigenere encoded text.

It provides encryption and decryption of texts with normal vigenere and the
autokey cipher. You may also use the brute force search if you know the key
size. After doing that you can sort the results by analysing the relative letter
frequency.
